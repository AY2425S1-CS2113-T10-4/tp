# User Guide

## Introduction

SpendSwift is a simple budgeting tool designed for budget-conscious users. With intuitive text commands, you can effortlessly track expenses and manage your finances without the complexity of traditional tools.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 17 or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest tp.jar file.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder where you placed the jar file, and run the following command to start the application: `java -jar tp.jar`
5. The application will start, and any existing tasks will be loaded from the file spendswift.txt. If this file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically when tasks are saved after exiting the program properly.
6. Type commands below the outputs and press Enter to execute them.

For details on all available commands, refer to the Features section below.

## Features
### Command Format Notes
1. Commands are case-insensitive: Command words can be typed in any combination of upper or lower case.

   Example: `add-expense` and `ADD-EXPENSE` are both valid.
2. Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters to be supplied by the user.

   Example: In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter, which can be used as `add n/Udon`.

3. All parameters are required unless specified: Every parameter must be supplied unless marked optional using square brackets `[ ]`.

   Example: In `add-expense n/NAME a/AMOUNT [c/CATEGORY]`, `add-expense n/Coffee a/5.50` is valid because `c/CATEGORY` is optional, while `add-expense` with no parameters will fail.

4. Order of parameters: Parameters can be provided in any order.

   Example: `add-expense n/Coffee a/5.50 c/Food` is equivalent to `add-expense a/5.50 n/Coffee c/Food`.

5. Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `view-expenses` and `bye`) will be ignored.

   Example: If the command specifies `view-expenses 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

6. Avoid using command prefixes (e.g., n/, a/, c/, etc.) within parameter values, as they may interfere with parsing. 

    Example: `add-expense n/Coffee 2023/02/12 a/5.50 c/Food` is valid, but `n/Coffee a/s/a/a/a/ a/5.50 c/Food` is not, 
as `a/` is used within the `NAME` parameter, causing confusion with the `a/AMOUNT` prefix.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 
**A**: Copy the `spendswift.txt` file from your SpendSwift home folder to the same folder on your new computer. 
Ensure the tp.jar file is also in the same folder. When you start the application on the new computer, 
it will load your saved expenses and categories from `spendswift.txt`.

**Q**: What happens if I enter an invalid command or make a typo?  
**A**: SpendSwift will display an error message if it doesn't recognize the command. 
Double-check the command format and ensure all required parameters are included. 
You can type `help` to see the correct command syntax and available options.

**Q**: Can I update or change an expenseâ€™s details after adding it?

To make changes, delete the existing expense using `delete-expense` and add a new one with the updated details.
