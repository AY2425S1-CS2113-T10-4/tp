# Developer Guide for SpendSwift

<!-- ## Acknoledgements -->

## Design & Implementation
### Architecture
A high-level overview of the system is shown in the Architecture Diagram below.

![Architecture Diagram](developerguidepictures/Architecture%20DIagram.drawio.png)

### Main Components  
SpendSwift class is in charge of launching the program, 
and initialising the components that does the main execution of the program.
- UI: Prints messages
- Parser: Determines the command to execute and checks the logic 
- Command: Determines the feature the user wants to use
- Storage: Writes data to, and reads data from hard disk

### SpendSwift
#### Purpose
Interface for command-line interactions.

#### Main flow
- The system starts and displays a greeting.
- Continuously processes user commands until "bye".

### Core Classes Overview
![CoreManagement](diagrams/CoreManagement.png)
#### TrackerData

TrackerData centralizes and manages the lists of categories, expenses, and budgets, 
providing a unified data source for other classes.

##### Usage
TrackerData is utilized by the manager classes to store and retrieve categorized data. 
Each manager accesses TrackerData to perform operations.

#### CategoryManager
Handles all category-related operations, including adding and formatting categories.

##### Operations

- `addCategory(String)`: Adds a new category.
- `formatCategoryInput(String)`: Formats category input, ensuring consistency.

##### Relationship
- Dependency: Accesses TrackerData to add and retrieve categories.

#### BudgetManager
Handles budget-related functionalities like setting and viewing budget limits for categories.

##### Operations
- `addBudgetLimit(String, double)`: Adds a budget limit for a specific category.
- `viewBudget()`: Views current budget limits and spending against them.
- `resetMonthlyBudget()`: Resets budgets at the start of each month.

##### Relationship
- Dependency: Accesses TrackerData to manage budget data associated with categories.

#### ExpenseManager
Manages expenses, including adding, deleting, and viewing expenses categorized by spending areas.

##### Operations
- `addExpense(String, double, String)`: Adds a new expense.
- `deleteExpense(int)`: Deletes an expense by index.
- `viewExpensesByCategory()`: Displays expenses grouped by category.

##### Relationship
- Dependency: Accesses TrackerData to add, delete, and view expenses categorized by spending areas.

### Command Parsing and Input Handling
![ParserManagement](diagrams/ParserManagement.png)
#### Parser
The Parser class interprets user input commands, delegating them to appropriate manager classes for processing.

##### Operations
- `parseCommand(String)`: Parses the command and creates a Command object based on the input.

##### Relationship
- Composition: Uses InputParser for handling command-specific parsing.
- Dependency: Delegates tasks to CategoryManager, BudgetManager, and ExpenseManager.

#### InputParser
InputParser processes specific components within commands (such as names, amounts, categories) 
and breaks down inputs for more manageable handling.

##### Operations
- `parseComponent(String)`: Breaks down input components into a map for easy retrieval.

### Expense, Category, and Budget Entities
![Entities](diagrams/Entities.png)

#### Expense
##### Purpose
Represents an expense with its name, amount, and associated category.

##### Operations
- `getName()`, `getAmount()`: Retrieve the expense's name and amount.
- `getCategory()`, `setCategory(Category)`: Manage the expense's category association.
- `formatAmount()`: Formats the expense amount for display.

#### Category
##### Purpose
Represents a category, allowing expenses and budgets to be organized under specific areas.

##### Operations
- `getName()`: Returns the category name.
- `toString()`: Provides the string representation of the category.

Attributes:
- String name: The name of the category.

#### Budget
##### Purpose
Represents a budget limit associated with a category, enabling users to track and manage spending.

##### Operations
- `setLimit(double)`: Ensures limits are non-negative.
- `formatLimit(double)`: Formats the budget limit for display.

- Each Expense is linked to exactly one Category, while each Budget is also associated with one Category.
